# Space_Invaders
 This is a clone of Space Invaders I made with the Python Turtle Module.

Wassup! 
the other files are the .gif images and .wav sounds you see/hear in the game.
this project was made in VSC and took two days.
if you want to run this in an IDE such as VSC, just copy this folder into it and run the Python file.
make sure you also copy the .gifs and .wavs into the folder.
this only runs on Windows
